Current project ability: scrape all the data needed. Model is correct (checked by looking at parameters, graphing the resulting line), but predict function is not working (not extrapolating for new dates)- need help. Once that is done, we can do profit.

On new store side, confused on inputs to linear model (ex. setting up)- dates + num. new stores? or just num new stores?
